# FAQ
Who/what is "CS"?
- CS stands for chat system.
- It's basically an auto bot that detects spam, kick attempts, and any client side changes.

Why doesn't (string) work?
- Because it isn't supported.

Why can't I type emojis into my message? Why do I have to use syntax?
- Scracth can't tell the difference between emojis, so you have to have some sort of syntax to differentiate them.

Why does this project look so low-budget?
- Because it is. This project is run on hopes and dreams.
- It's hard to make a functional text display, and lists are easier to work with. Let me know if anyone comes up with anything that I could use.

Did you make this by yourself?
- Yes, I did. Solo project. You can tell it's mine by how messy and clunky it is.

Why can't I kick people or make announcements?
- Because you can't.

# Problems I know exist:
- Userlist is still a little buggy.
- Local storage isn't saved, this is impossible to implement.
- Word wrap is clunky
- No filter
